/* Exploring SQL Queries using Multi-Table and Data Relationships

Overview:
In real-world databases, data is often distributed across multiple tables. The challenge lies in efficiently combining and analyzing this data to derive meaningful insights. 

This project demonstrates how SQL databases:
* Handle many-to-many relationships.
* Utilize entity relationship diagrams (ERDs).
* Apply various types of joins and unions.
* Use bridge tables for complex relationships.
* Implement reusable views.
* Using subqueries to enhance query flexibility and improve data retrieval.

Technology Used
1) SQL
2) Azure SQL Database
3) AdventureWorks Database: A Microsoft sample db representing a fictional bicycle manufacturing company, containing sales, customer, product, employee, and financial data
for learning SQL queries and database relationships.

/* Conclusion:
This project showcases how SQL can be used to efficiently query and analyze data across multiple tables. 
By leveraging joins, unions, views and subqueries, businesses can extract critical insights for decision-making. 
The techniques demonstrated here are fundamental for database management, business intelligence, and data analysis roles.
